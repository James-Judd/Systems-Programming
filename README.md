Connect 4 Twist and Turn\
A game of Connect 4 on a cylindrical board where, after a piece is placed, you can choose to rotate a row either left or right.\
Remember the board wraps around on each side, and rotated pieces will drop down if their new spot has space below it!\
\
Instructions:\
\
To rotate a row, input the number of the row you wish to rotate: positive rotates to the right, negative rotates to the left.\
E.g.
4 will rotate row 4, one space to the right\
-3 will rotate row 3, one space to the left\
0 will end your turn without rotating any rows\
\
To exit the game, enter any non-integer input\
\
To play, download the folder, compile connect4.c with main.c and run the application.\
\
Edit initial_board.txt to play on a board of any size, and even with starting pieces!\
\
I have also included an analytical report of my code.
